# Shahu-Black-Hole-Bridge-Hypothesis-SBBH-
SBBH (Shahu Black Hole Bridge Hypothesis) says black holes are bridges to parallel universes, transferring energy and information to balance entropy across the multiverse—preserving both thermodynamic and quantum laws.

## 🌌 Overview

SBBH proposes that **black holes are not endpoints**, but act as **bridges between parallel universes**. They transfer **energy and quantum information** through a multiversal structure to **balance entropy** and preserve fundamental laws of physics across universes.

## 🔭 Core Concepts

### 1. Black Holes as Entropy Bridges
- Black holes remove high-entropy energy/matter from one universe.
- This energy is not lost, but **transferred** into a lower-entropy universe.
- The bridge preserves **thermodynamic equilibrium** on a multiversal scale.

### 2. Information Conservation without Hawking Radiation
- Hawking radiation is not required to carry information.
- Instead, **information is conserved via transfer** through the black hole to another universe.
- This resolves the **Black Hole Information Paradox** in a new way.

### 3. Multiversal Energy Flow
- Energy that falls into a black hole may emerge in another universe as:
  - A **white hole**
  - A **low-entropy burst**
  - A **universe-reset event**

### 4. Entropy Balance Equation
Let:
- ΔS₁ = entropy change in Universe 1 (with black hole)
- ΔS₂ = entropy change in Universe 2 (receiving energy/info)

Then:
ΔS₁ + ΔS₂ = 0 I₁ = I₂ E_in(BH_U₁) = E_out(WH_U₂)

## 🧪 Theoretical Implications

- **Preserves quantum information** without needing it to remain in our universe.
- Suggests **black hole–white hole pairs** as cross-universal links.
- Explains entropy reversal mechanisms through **external energy input**.
- Supports multiversal interpretation of **quantum and thermodynamic laws**.

## 🚀 Summary

**SBBH** transforms black holes from cosmic ends to **multiversal bridges**, aligning with SEBT’s vision of a dynamic, entropy-balanced multiverse. It provides a fresh resolution to the information paradox and reframes black holes as essential components of inter-universal energy and entropy flow.
